 Question :-  What is async and defer?
 Answer:-  Async and defer are attributes in HTML that help load pages faster by downloading scripts in 
           the background. 
           Async = Async tells the browser to continue parsing HTML while the script is downloaded, and then
                   executes the script as soon as it's downloaded.
           
           defer = Defer allows the browser to continue parsing HTML while the script is downloaded, and then executes 
                   the script after the HTML parsing is complete.
